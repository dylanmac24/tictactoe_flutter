This Flutter app is meant to be my take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game where a user competes against an AI opponent. The game features a 3x3 board, three difficulty levels, undo functionality and persistent score tracking that saves wins, losses and draws across sessions using local storage.

All core logic, AI behaviour and storage features are unit tested to ensure reliable performance and correct gameplay behaviour.
